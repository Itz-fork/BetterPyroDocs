# Better Pyro Docs
Simple & Better search engine to search for pyrogram docs


# Why?
Even though the pyrogram documentation's search feature is enough for most of the users, I find it's kinda difficult to use


# How?
- It scrapes and caches a list of pyrogram's API methods and raw functions (along with some additional info like what the function does, etc.).
- After caching, it reads and saves that data in a Mongodb atlas database.
